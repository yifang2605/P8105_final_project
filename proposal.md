## Motivation

Mental health is an important part of overall health and well-being.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social
well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps
determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy
choices. Mental health is essential from childhood and adolescence
through adulthood.

The impact of Covid-19 on mental illnesses like depression and anxiety
are still under investigation. The CDC reports that mental illness can
increase the risk of diabetes, stroke and heart disease and has
recognized that severe mental illness can increase the likelihood of a
person becoming seriously ill after contracting COVID-19.

## Intended final products

The final product will be a website that includes data summaries,
visualizations, a screencast, written report and corresponding github
repository containing all relevant program files and outputs related to
the project. The website is open for public audiences and aims to engage
with the public, especially for people who are suffering from or
interested in mental health problems. Also, we expect our website could
help people maintain mental health and wellness.
