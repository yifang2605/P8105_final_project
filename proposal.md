## Motivation

Mental health is an important part of overall health and well-being.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social
well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps
determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy
choices. Mental health is essential from childhood and adolescence
through adulthood.

The impact of Covid-19 on mental illnesses like depression and anxiety
are still under investigation. The CDC reports that mental illness can
increase the risk of diabetes, stroke and heart disease and has
recognized that severe mental illness can increase the likelihood of a
person becoming seriously ill after contracting COVID-19.
